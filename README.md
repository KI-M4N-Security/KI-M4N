# KI-M4N BLUE PILL / MEDUSA PROJECT
🟦 SKIN v0.1 — Human‑Centric Defensive Operations Platform
CREATED BY KI-MAN SECURITY RESEARCHER

Fast. Local. Human‑Readable.
SKIN is a lightweight defensive operations stack for operators who want answers, not dashboards full of noise.

🧠 Philosophy

Most security stacks are built for enterprises.

SKIN is built for:

Solo defenders

Small teams

Red/Blue operators

Labs, field ops, rapid response

No SIEM fatigue. No vendor lock‑in. No nonsense.

SKIN answers one core question:

“What is happening right now, and should I care?”

🟦 Why SKIN instead of a SIEM?
Traditional SIEM	SKIN
Heavy ingestion	Selective visibility
Alert overload	Human‑labeled signals
Enterprise‑only	Laptop → Server ready
Weeks to tune	Usable in minutes

SKIN is not a replacement for enterprise SIEMs.

It’s a tactical layer — the place where humans actually look.

🧩 What’s Inside (v0.1)
🧠 Brain

OpenSearch – fast, local, open

OpenSearch Dashboards – human‑first visuals

🛰 Sensors

Zeek – network metadata (what really happened)

Suricata – IDS (quiet, intentional rules)

osquery – endpoint truth

🚚 Transport

Filebeat – lightweight log shipping

All orchestrated with Docker Compose.

You are responsible for how you deploy and use it.

🟦 Final Note

SKIN is opinionated by design.

If you want:

More data → use a SIEM

More alerts → buy a product

If you want clarity → use SKIN.

Built by operators, for operators.
